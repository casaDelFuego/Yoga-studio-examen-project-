This is my examenarbete project.

Gatsby + Firebase + Styled components

A page for a yoga studio that contains information about courses and a booking system to book a lesson.
The booking system is rather strange, it shows the avalible lessons by week and then it converts to the actual date "under the hood".

User authentification is via Google, users can book lessons and see their bookings on the personal acoount page after log in.

One of the features is an Admin access page where a teacher (or the owner of the studio) can add new lessons and see how many people have had booked a particular lesson.
